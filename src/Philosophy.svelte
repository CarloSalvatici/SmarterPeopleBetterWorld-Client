			I believe that understanding the world as much as possible is what I, and everyone should be doing with their lives.

			What should I do with my experience?

		<div class="my-2">
			In order to figure this out, I need to comprehend the various things involved with my experience best I can.

			It seems to me that its most effective to blame intelligence and wisdom for the state of people's moods. 
			If we are smarter then we are able to solve our problems which will make us happier. Therefore, intelligence and wisdom positively correlate to happiness. 
		</div>
		<div class="my-2">
			If we are not smart we cannot effectively solve our problems and will continue to suffer unhappiness. 
			Maybe knowing more can mean you see more of the problems which is why people say the more you know the worse you feel, but go one step further into knowing how to solve them?
			Perpetuation of the "ignorance is bliss" is misleading. It's short term because the problems eventually grow to a point where they cannot be ignored anymore, harming either you or someone else.

		<div class="my-2">
			<b>Our process of understanding the world:</b>
		</div>
		<div class="my-2">
			It seems to me like the most important is to understand understanding itself. How exactly do we process information? How do various factors affect our comprehension?
			Knowing more about the answers to these questions increases intelligence, which allows for a faster build-up of wisdom. 
		</div>
		<div class="my-2">
			Another effective way to speed things up is through teamwork. There are many ways in which multiple people working on this at once can speed things up.
			When it comes to building wisdom, this is very apparent as knowledge can be shared with sufficient intelligence and communication skills.
